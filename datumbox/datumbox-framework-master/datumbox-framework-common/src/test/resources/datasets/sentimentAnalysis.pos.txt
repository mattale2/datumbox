Recommended                 Movie:  The Silence is a very interesting Iranian movie that combines the realism and humanism that many have come to expect from today's Iranian film. But it also adds a poetic and musical element that takes the film into the realm of what might be called realism fantasy.  Directed by famed Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf the film is about a blind ten-year-old immigrant boy from Tajikistan named Khorshid. He walks everywhere with his eyes closed but he has pitch perfect hearing, which has helped him get a job in a music shop tuning guitars.  Khorshid loves music and delightful sounds so much that he often forgets where he is going and gets lost while following the sounds around him. To remedy this each morning as he gets on the bus to go to work he puts cotton in his ears and covers them so he won't following music. Each day he gets off the bus he is greeted by an elev...Read the entire review

Highly Recommended                 The Movie:  When Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 classic begins, we watch a man light a cigarette, alone in his scantily decorated hotel room ? the lights are dim, he seems to exist in the shadows. He enjoys his cigarette, gets dressed, puts on his hat and heads out onto the streets of Paris, alone, all in a very rigid and ritualistic fashion.  Loneliness is a huge part of what makes Le Samourai such a mesmerizing film. We've all felt alone before, we've all had melancholy days where we felt completely abandoned and it's these all too human traits that make Alain Delon's performance as Jef Costello so impressive ? we really feel for the guy despite the fact that he's a cold blooded murderer by trade. Before Costello breaths a single word to anyone in the film, we're already pulled into his world. We want to know more about him, he's obviously a mysterious man and despite the...Read the entire review

Fred Barnes provides six reasons why "conservatives have turned on Bush."  Along the way, Barnes takes up the question of whether Bush actually is a conservative.  He writes:  Bush, of course, is a conservative, but a different kind of conservative. His tax cuts, support for social issues, hawkish position on national security and terrorism, and rejection of the Kyoto protocols make him so. He's also killed the ABM and Comprehensive Test Ban treaties, kept the United States out of the international criminal court, defied the United Nations, and advocated a shift in power from Washington to individuals through an "ownership society." On some issues--partial privatization of Social Security is the best example--he is a bolder conservative than Ronald Reagan, the epitome of a conventional conservative. "  My view is that Bush is not a conservative when it comes to domestic issues.  In a series of posts in 2003 and early 2004, I argued that he's more of a third way guy.  See, for example,  here,  here (in which I disagree with a piece by Barnes), and  here.  However, I'm not one of those conservatives who has turned on Bush.  I wholeheartedly support him for the same reason I did when I wrote the above posts -- his aggressive prosecution of the war on terror.  Besides, do we get a more conservative domestic policy if Bush becomes weaker?  I doubt it.

I enjoyed this paper, a look at online learning that takes as a point of departure ?Reflections on Liberation,? by Suzanne Pharr, which discusses liberation politics as a means of ?breaking down the barriers that prevent a large portion of the population from having access to economic and social justice.? What I found interesting was the comprison between communities of practice (or, more accurately, communities of interest) today and the practice of identity politics in previous eras. As Pharr notes, there is always a risk that these communities can become ?limited, hierarchical [in their] approach, reducing people of multiple identities to a single identity.? [] [Tags: ] []

I met Paul Wellstone only one time, but it was memorable to me.  It was the day after the Jewish new year six or seven years ago.  We had just had my family over for the holiday, including the brother (Alan E.) of a cousin-in-law who had worked as an aide to the senator in Washington.  He told me at length how much he liked the senator and how much he had enjoyed working for him.    The next day I was at the airport leaving town and happened to look into the news stand on the concourse from which I was departing.  I noticed someone plunking down one copy of each daily newspaper the stand carried.  Looking up, I saw that it was the senator.  I greeted him, introduced myself, and he greeted me warmly.  I told him I'd been campaign treasurer for Rudy Boschwitz in his second race against him (in 1996), the one in which he had whomped Rudy.  He turned down his friendliness only a little, but inquired in detail about Alan.    Much as I was predisposed to dislike him, and much as I wanted to, I left with a warm feeling for him personally and know I would have enjoyed talking with him at greater length.  Although I was struck in person by how short he was, unlike many other politicians whom I have met, he was larger -- not smaller -- than life.  Senator Wellstone died in a tragic accident in the midst of his reelection campaign against Norm Coleman three years ago today.  At the American Enterprise, my friend Dan Ritchie takes a look at the development of the Wellstone cult in Minnesota since Senator Wellstone's death: "Blessed Paul Wellstone."

By now allowing employees to use the technology, firms can regulate and monitor potentially sensitive content and employee usage. They have also realized the productivity benefits of utilizing Instant Messaging as a very important communication tool. Teams can now quickly ask a coworker a question, send over a file instantly across IM technology, or host a teleconference. We are pretty much all familiar with the use of AOL Instant Messaging in our own personal use. However, there are more robust and dynamic commercial applications being further developed by IBM and Microsoft. Let me know what you think.

How France can win from offshoring  From Mckinsy Quarterly  France is relatively new to offshoring, but the trend will probably accelerate as French companies try to keep pace with foreign competitors that increasingly send service jobs to countries with low-cost labor. Resisting the offshoring trend would be counterproductive over the long term. Offshoring helps companies to reduce costs, thereby freeing resources for development and ultimately creating more jobs, both at home and abroad. France could gain from offshoring, but to do so the country must create more jobs, encourage innovation, and make the job market more flexible so that laid-off workers can find new employment quickly. To ease the plight of displaced workers, some of the cost savings from offshoring could finance income protection and other assistance programs  To take advantage of outsourcing in India, contact A-1 Technology, Inc, an offshore outsourcing company.

Reasons why outsourcing to India is booming ..  Offshore outsourcing or Offshoring (as it has come to be known) is one of the major sectors of Indian economy now. For the First World countries, especially USA ,Offshore Outsourcing to India is one of the most popular management practices today. Though prompted generally by the cost reduction factor, this is just one of the reasons one should consider offshore outsourcing. Most outsourcing parties are unaware of the fact that Indian Service Providers offer not just cost effective solutions, but also value addition by improving yield and quality. As per the NASSCOM reports \u2013 on www.nasscom.org : Today, MNCs are rushing into India to stake a claim to the IT outsourcing market. While a large number of companies are outsourcing their software development to Indian companies, others are establishing a presence in India and participating actively in the software export game. The MNC sector emerged as an important segment contributing Rs 9,855 crore of the total exports of Rs 35,600 crore in the year 2001-02, translating into 27% share of the total exports. IST (Indian Standard Time) is ahead of all the First World Countries (with the possible exception of Japan ) and it is approximately 12 hrs. ahead of the American Standard Time .Which means that the Americans can get their job/s done through Offshore Outsourcing even when their official working hours are over. This way the no. of possible working hours - both for the client as well as the service provider becomes 24 hrs.

THE WORLD ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR HEWSON  A college campus lecture about AIDS delivered by a guy named Paul Hewson?  Not my idea of a well-spent Friday night.  Except, of course, that Paul Hewson is Bono, which made his lecture last week in Penn's 1,260 seat Irvine Auditorium a tougher ticket than, well, a U2 concert at the Wachovia Center.  Having had the pleasure of the latter no less than three times this calendar year alone, I was anxious to get a look at 'Professor Hewson.' We all know he can sing. And those of us who have watched him singing live know he possesses a sense of "cool" that can only be God-given. But in advance, I wondered whether the man who spellbinds stadium crowds, the rock superstar who has just graced the covers of both the New York Times Magazine and Rolling Stone, could make an intellectual case for social change to even non-liberals, like me?  The answer is yes.  He did it by being: funny (beginning his speech by saying he was nervous because he's not used to playing rooms with less than 20,000 people), engaging about very serious subject matter (effectively using a story told to him by Congressman Tom Lantos to equate indifference to African AIDS with facilitation of the Holocaust), and deft (knowing, for example, how to strike the right balance between tweaking, but not alienating, the Bush Administration -- was he "surprised" or "delighted" by the president's awareness of his issues?).  This was Bono, in his role as co-founder of DATA (debt, AIDS, trade and Africa) captivating a crowd that looked more like the Parents Association of the Lower Merion Soccer League than a roomful who'd come to hear a rock superstar. But that is the point, really. Bono is using his celebrity to put a subject into the living room of individuals -- like me -- who are unaccustomed to wearing social activism on our sleeves. For that, he deserves the accolades he receives. He is making American suburbanites knowledgeable about the plight of individuals whose future welfare will have no bearing on our lives.  Or will it?  Bono made the humanitarian case for addressing debt, AIDS, trade and Africa, but he also put forth what I thought was a bold argument based on national security. As he often does, Bono said that the toll of AIDS in Africa is the equivalent of two "9/11's" per day. Imagine that. The Twin Towers, Pentagon and Shanksville, times two every day -- reason enough, to be sure, for American attention. But he also reminded the crowd that poverty leads to despair, and that despair leads to violence.  In other words, the war on terror demands our attention to Africa now.  This self pro-claimed "fan" of America, who repeatedly professed his "love" for our country, reminded the audience that right now, "brand America" needs friends in the world, and Bono argued that given Africa's 40% Muslim composition, it was in America's best security interest to address the problems of Africa now, rather than face possible consequences, later.  "The better world happens to be the safer world; it's a pretty good bargain."  It was a compelling case. And maybe he's uniquely suited to make it. Bono is a very special guy: Monogamous in a world of opportunity born of adulation; loyal to four guys and a manager who've been joined at the hip for three decades; a lone voice on the domestic and international world who is able to transcend the Fox vs. CNN crosstalk in which we live; someone able to get a standing ovation on an Ivy League campus the same week he had lunch with the President; and a man who once enticed Jesse Helms, hearing aid and all, to a U2 show.  Hell, Bono has been able to unite Rick Santorum and Act Up on the same page to fight AIDS in Africa. Top that!  And how does he use his stature? By spending an 'off' Friday night while his band is touring not throwing a TV set out of a hotel room window, but by traveling from Washington to Philadelphia to make the case to one thousand Americans for the need to get active solving the problems of Africa.  Very cool indeed.  No wonder that Bono has enlisted two million Americans to support his One campaign.  Ok, make it two million and one.

Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel. A special place on our honor roll must be reserved for these two Knight Ridder reporters, and their Washington bureau chief, John Walcott. As media critic Michael Massing wrote in The New York Review of Books, Knight Ridder "almost alone among national news organizations...decided to take a hard look at the administration's justifications for war." On Feb. 5, 2004, Landay and Strobel were awarded the Raymond Clapper Memorial Award from the Washington Press Club Foundation for their coverage. And in August 2004, the American Journalism Review singled the two out for praise, calling their stories "compelling," and noting that, "on many occasions, it seemed like they were banging the drum alone."  Here are excerpts from two of their articles:  On October 8, 2002, they wrote in an article titled, "Bush Hawks Accused of Distortions; Experts List Case After Case of Misleading the Public About Iraq":  A growing number of military, intelligence and diplomatic leaders have deep misgivings about the Bush administration's march toward war in Iraq.  These officials say administration hawks have publicly exaggerated evidence of the threat that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein poses, including:  Distorting his links to the al-Qaida terrorist network.  Overstating the amount of international support for attacking Iraq.  Downplaying the potential repercussions of a new war in the Middle East.  They also say intelligence analysts are under intense pressure to produce reports supporting the White House's argument against Saddam. "  On October 27, 2002, the two followed up with an article titled, "Infighting Among U.S. Intelligence Agencies Fuels Dispute over Iraq."  The Pentagon and the CIA are waging a bitter feud over secret intelligence that is being used to shape U.S. policy toward Iraq, according to current and former U.S. officials...The dispute pits hardliners long distrustful of the U.S. intelligence community against professional military and intelligence officers who fear the hawks are shaping intelligence analyses to support their case for invading Iraq.

Offshore Outsourcing Benefits to US Economy  From Hindu Business line  Ultimately Offshore Outsourcing of service work will generate jobs in America\u2019s export business, lower domestic firms\u2019 expenses, and raise the worth and number of services for consumers at lesser prices. If government hinders with the ability of U.S. businesses to outsource, Americans will all lose. Instead of altering the figure of jobs, free trade changes the mix of jobs in the country to mirror those areas in which we have the utmost competitive edge. Worldwide trade in services expands the progression of job specialization and enhances living standards. If outsourcing continues to be subdued in the U.S., American firms will need to rely on a well paid staff even for low-profile jobs, hence creating dearer U.S. commodities which would not be as competitive in the globe market. Outlawing outsourcing could therefore eradicate additional jobs in the U.S. Taking advantage of the cheap labour in developing countries, many MNCs have set up subsidiaries in India and elsewhere. In the past decade, US companies alone have invested $7 billion in their subsidiaries in India, reaping a net saving of more than $26 billion. Telstra, an Australian telecom company, for instance, saved more than $75 million a year by outsourcing many jobs to Indian enterprises. This is a clear indication that, despite divided opinions in the US, Britain and other countries, corporate managements will continue to favour outsourcing. On the employment front, there are two schools of thought: One, that outsourcing is leading to massive unemployment; and, two, that it has not contributed to unemployment, as is sought to be made out. In fact, as pointed out in a recent report by the US Chamber of Commerce, the main cause of increased unemployment in the US, Britain and other developed countries is the enhancement in productivity due to continuing advancements in technology. The report quotes the example of General Motors (GM) in the US. While three decades ago, the company used to employ over 4,50,000 workers to produce five million vehicles annually, it now employs less than 1,18,000 hands to turn out the same number of vehicles. This reduction is mainly due to the evolution of designing, manufacturing, assembling and testing technologies including robotics.  The article sponsored by A-1 Technology Inc, dealing in offshore outsourcing and software development outsourcing.

In praise of the blog  Well, I enjoyed blogging and I think it is a great idea for a few reasons  1. It is the latest talk of the town as a tool of communication and influence- I feel quite a lot more technologically competent and knowledgeable, now that I have been a blogger myself.  2. It made the CIS class exciting. We have put our learning into practice. As Nonaka says, we have internalised (Explicit to tacit!!) the learning as we continue to read and write about key concepts that were discussed in class.  3. I think we have learnt not just lessons but a 'habit' - I'm sure most of us will continue to be bloggers long after our grades are published.  I regret though that we have not been able to make an impact on society, like most bloggers do!

Last Saturday I got to attend a statewide coalition building conference organized by Indiana Progressives.  There were people from all over the state representing Democracy for Monroe County, Michiana for Democracy, Democracy for Morgan County, Downtown Indianapolis Meetup, Indiana Progressives, and Greater Lafayette Democracy for America, Indianapolis Northside Meetup, and Southern Indiana DFA.  Even more progressive groups in Indiana joined the conference in the afternoon.  Our special thanks go to all those who took time out of their weekends to be there and make this a great event&#151;and to Scott Alber, Eldon Robison, Roberta Schonemann, Shaw Friedman, and many others for making it happen so smoothly.  There's a lot of stuff going in Indiana, ranging from the Elect Six by '06 campaign to get 6 progressive legislatures elected to the State House, to Katrina relief efforts, to coalition building with like-minded groups in diverse constituencies.  We were also graced with several candidates running for a variety of offices.  They spoke to their commitment to stand up for what they believe in, and our capabilities toward supporting their efforts. And yes, we came away with much better sense of group activities around the state and the priorities that can be shared statewide.    I've had the privilege of attending over twenty of these conferences since last March.  Every one has been a different and great experience.  As we all gear up for the last three weeks of the 2005 election cycle, the candidates, the initiatives and referendums that we are all participating in, I can honestly say that I have never seen a more dedicated effort toward taking this country back that is so consistent everywhere I go.    Check out the Indiana Progressives' website at: http://www.indianaprogressives.com/. And while you're at it, start thinking about candidates for local office whom we should be helping in the next cycle, both in Indiana and elsewhere.

Highly Recommended                 The Movie:  One of the most interesting things about Fritz Lang's classic Edward G. Robinson vehicle, Scarlet Street, is how it makes us think about what we're watching and more specifically about the character motivation. It's obvious, at least on the surface of the film, that some of the characters are doing what most would consider literal 'wrong' but when you step back and take in the larger picture, do their reasons for their actions justify what they've done? When someone does 'wrong' for the 'right reasons' does that somehow reverse it?  That's the basic train of thought that runs through the story of Christopher Cross (Robinson), an everyman type who has worked for the last few decades of his life as a lowly cashier. He doesn't have much to show for his years of service aside from the standard gold watch and, in the grand scheme of things, he really hasn't accomp...Read the entire review

Embarrassing Confession Time    Because I have no other topic ready for blogging.  I find Kofi Annan's voice the sexiest one in the whole universe. This is a handicap in some ways. For example, I never hear a word of what he is saying because I go into an immediate bedroom swoon whenever he's on the television or radio (though it's the voice that has this effect, not Annan's looks).  His voice is like dark molasses, like a moist summer wind on a dark night after a hot day, like a glass of Guinness when one is parched, like feathers and velvet and cognac. No politician deserves a voice like that.

The newest film from French director-writer-actor Ga?l Morel (Full Speed, Wild Reeds) is an emotionally rich story about three brothers who are each facing a crucial turning point in their lives.
EMAIL OF THE DAY: "I'm a straight guy who is rather left-wing, and loves the recent convergence between independent conservatives and kossacks on topical issues such as torture, Miers, fiscal sanity, pork, and gay marriage. Both sides can use the dose of the other.  I live with a buddy and I'll be the happiest drunk in the crowd when he marries his long-term boyfriend. Tonight I was out for Friday drinks with 4 beautiful girls (2 couples) and only laughed at my "minority" status, loving the open frankness of discussion.  While I understand the "creativity" concerns to an extent, progressives (and their allies) know better. Spontaneity, inspiration, shared, lasting values - the key factors in generating "culture" do not require oppression.  The flourishing, mainstream introduction of my (youngish) friends' perspective is as wonderful as it is radical.  The end of gay culture?  Hardly. Cultures can develop as well in the open as in secret. So long as truth is at its root."
Near the end of director Luis Mandoki's film Innocent Voices, the lead character, 11-year-old Chava, must choose whether to kill another boy while in the midst of a firefight between El Salvadoran army troops and guerillas with the FMLN. Sadly, it is a choice made by too many children throughout the world today. Though the setting of the film is in the turbulent early 80's El Salvador, the wartime experiences it recounts are still being replayed.              Based on the life of its screenwriter, Oscar Torres, Innocent Voices is arguably one of the most powerful movies ever made about the impact of war on civilians. As a young person growing up in the Central American nation, Torres and his peers feared reaching twelve years old, as that was the age at which the government army forcibly recruited boys to fight the leftist insurgency. Courageously, he and director Mandoki evoke a bitter, humane narrative which laudably does not shy away from the emotional and physical damage wrought by conflict.              Over the last several years, I have documented the lives of war-affected children living on both sides of the gun throughout the world, including nations still fighting such as Colombia, Sri Lanka and Uganda. Until recently, journalists, interested observers, and humanitarian workers only knew the hard, cold numbers of the child soldier experience. In more than three dozen conflicts around the globe between 300,000 and 500,000 children under the age of 18 years are actively participating in combat as scouts, cooks, porters, sexual servants and front-line fighters. The only avenues out for these child warriors are capture, risky escape, wounding, or death.              Because of Innocent Voices, we now know so much more about what happens to children when adults fight. The poet Edna St. Vincent Millay once wrote, "Childhood is the kingdom where nobody dies." Through Oscar "Chava" Torres' life, we see that for the youngest witnesses to war death is an expectation and hope, faith, and optimism are the first casualties. The El Salvador of his youth was a place where fathers were mostly unseen and adulthood was dreaded.  The graceful Chilean actress Leonor Varela is Chava's mother in the movie, and like so many women whom I met throughout traveling Africa and Latin America, hers is an awe-inspiring, constant well of strength. The first-time actor Carlos Padilla plays Oscar Torres as a child in a performance which can only be described as transcendental. The expression on his face during the climactic scene by a river is bound to haunt viewers for days afterwards. Watching the film, which I've done half a dozen times, I find myself struck by the realism and clarity of its vision.  As a writer who's recently completed a book on child soldiers and war-affected children, I never fail to discover something new. More importantly for me, personally, has been the gift of friendship with Oscar Torres, Luis Mandoki and the film's producer, Lawrence Bender. Sometimes, you find magic in unforeseen collaborations, such as theirs. "Innocent Voices" is graphic, often brutal, but ultimately inspiring. This is a movie which has an aesthetic and social obligation to be seen.  Leaving the theater, one hopefully will be moved to advocacy, and action. More information about the film can be found at .

Lower wages in some countries are also a huge incentive to move operations, especially since high-speed communication removes many of the barriers to dealing with U.S.-based colleagues and customers. Therefore, numerous MNCs in USA, Europe, Australia, and Japan have initiated IPOs (International Procurement Organizations) in developing third world countries particlulary India, China, Mexico and Brazil.  &nbsp;Offshore Outsourcing ensues largely in the IT sector, followed by medical transcription and other health care-related jobs, automotive spares/components, engineering segment, and business processing, accounting, advertising, , Human Resource Management and Development, ,&nbsp; financial investment and consultancy, legal services, and network security. The Statistics  But Offshore Outsourcing nonetheless has also truncated millions of job opportunities in the respective home countries. Over 2.2 million people in the US alone lost their jobs in the preceding four years.  US Senate is contemplating to ban Offshore Outsourcing of government contracts. This posits an ironic premise US, in theory, stalwartly campaigns for global acceptance of free trade practices, but in practice it mulls over legal restraints to offshore outsourcing from foreign lands. But the recoil may be puffed up. One of the hottest studies designates that the trend may actually be creating more jobs.  In the past decade, US companies single-handedly have devoted $7 billion in their ancillary operations in India, garnering a profit in excess of $26 billion. Telstra, an Australian telecom company, for instance, accumulated more than $75 million a year by outsourcing several assignments to Indian ventures proving an apparent clue that, notwithstanding separated outlooks in the US, Britain, France, Germany, and other first world countries, corporate administrations will persist favoring offshore outsourcing. On the employment side, there are two standpoints: first, deeming that outsourcing creates massive joblessness; and, second, contrariwise. Indeed, as pointed out in a report by the US Chamber of Commerce, the main reason of increased unemployment in the US, Britain and other developed countries is the augmentation in yield due to continuing advancements in technology. Quoting the instance of GM (General Motors) in USA three decades ago the report says that it used to engage larger than 4,50,000 workers to produce five million automobiles / year, and now it utilizes under 1,18,000 hands to manufacture the same number of vehicles. This reduction is attributable to the advancement of designing, mechanization, assembling and testing gizmology together with robotics.  An All Winning Premise The theory of outsourcing is also technology- motivated&nbsp; anchored in the principle that one must outsource low-tech data entry jobs requiring more of&nbsp; manual labour and focus on central activities, exploration and advance of innovative gizmologies. While the proceeds generated from Offshoring be utilized for further expansion and&nbsp; technology innovation and specialization thus engendering fresh and superior employment openings.  An account primed by McKinsey Global Institute for the US Chamber of Commerce has avowed that: "A US company earns on an average a net profit of $1.12 to $1.14 by outsourcing work for which it pays $1.0 abroad." It additionally acknowledged that by offshoring low paid jobs abroad, US capital, fiscal or intellectual, can be exploiedt to spawn more lucrative and superior revenue generating jobs. The report also affirmed that by outsourcing assignments to India and other developing countries, many US / European companies are also establishing new markets in such countries. Call centers so grounded in India or other developing countries are being fundamentally outfitted with US or European gizmos like Compaq / HP Computers, Microsoft software, Lucent phones and Carrier air conditioners.  A Stalemate Position But if the US senate puts a ban on Offshore Outsourcing or impedes it in any way then the US will then have to depend on costlier personnel even for low-tech data entry jobs jobs. Consequently, wares made in US factories will become dearer as compared to the global market and therefore in competitive, which shall yet again pressurize US corporations enormously of closure or diminution in output; resulting still in job loss for many.   &nbsp;

Outsourcing : A good flip  Reaction by some US customers has also been negative. According to an article published at bambooweb "Many customers of Dell complained of an inability to effectively communicate with their support staff, which Dell outsourced to India, because of their heavy Indian accents. Due to negative customer reaction and negative publicity, Dell moved some of its tech phone support jobs back to the US, most notably for corporate customers, though they stated they still plan to augment their Indian staff. " But what I want to convey us that "Outsourcing needs to be considered as an appreciator of assets inspite the apprehensions that keep arising due to some examples that are quoted against the concept of outsourcing. This is because outsourcing is not only a progressive approach towards consolidation of any business offshore but also helps is bringing together the best of both worlds at a proficient platform at highly reasonable rates. Outsourcing is a concept that is no longer new .It has been tread safely by many successful businessmen to seek more success for their big and small businesses alike. As they say that there are two sides of each coin. Similarly outsourcing cannot be casted as an adverse phenomenon in the global market just because of some instances of a bad flip. We started the discussion from a negative mark now lets proceed to viewing the other side of the coin which is more positive. Other companies report favorable results, however. One company said that the low cost of his Indian development team allows him to hire higher-paid American lead developers."

Also the idea was to have more of a discussion, but the discussion usually ended at maximum one or two reponses. Overall the experience was really unique and great.

That's what Red State calls the Coburn Amendment.  The Coburn Amendment may prove to be a historic rallying point for the forces of limited government and fiscal sanity.  Then again, it may not.  But it's a good place to start.  The amendment is very simple:  it proposes to redirect the ridiculous $220 million earmarked for the Alaskan "bridge to nowhere" to Hurricane Katrina relief; specifically, reconstruction of the Twin Spans Bridge that connects New Orleans with Slidell, Louisiana.  Red State says that the "Bridge to Nowhere" will cost enough to buy every one of the 50 residents of Gravina Island a Lear Jet.  It's hard to see how anyone will justify voting against Coburn's amendment, so the forces of reaction are reported to be fighting to keep it from coming to a vote.

How shopping in Brooklyn is like shopping in Kathmandu?  I like Faye's ideas, and yes there are technologies to do everything you said: architecture to hair simulations. It is the matter of how willing a customer is to spend more money, how technology friendly a business is and how much competitive advantage does the businesses want.  That brings me to my comment. When I lived in Arizona, I did most of my shopping in big department stores such as Target, Safeway (Grocery Store), etc. At Target, they provided scanners where I could scan an item to find the correct price and to see if any discounts were being offered.  I liked it because I did not have to mentally calculate the final price after discounts and taxes. It was definitely different from being in Kathmandu, where I had to be careful about how much I was being charged and depending on the store, I had to haggle for bargains (even for food). But now, I am in Brooklyn, and I feel like I am back in Kathmandu because local grocery stores do not even have technology to scan the items. The counter person has to memorize all the prices, and as a customer I have to be proactive to check that I am being charged the right price. Especially when there are discounts being offered, and it is just too much for the person to remember the correct price after discounts.  Well in case of Kathmandu, it is not that backwards in adopting technology. Last winter, when I went to Kathmandu, I was very excited to find department stores using scanners to check out the items. I think it is a step towards the right direction, and hopefully Brooklyn will follow.

Media interview  Interviewer: So, tell us about Share & Learn...Peter: Well, Share & Learn is basically a network that helps people and companies learn, and have FUN while learning.What is it that's different about your organization?We're NOT a typical organization. We're a network, like the Internet. Totally decentralized. So there is no limit to how fast or how big we can grow.What is it that makes Share & Learn grow?We all need to learn from others, and at the same time, we need to SHARE what we've learned. In fact, the more we share what we know, the more we become fluent and the more we master our knowledge.As our members share their knowledge, they recruit new members into the network, so the network grows steadily.You mentioned that "something huge is going on"...For the first time in history, we have all the technologies enabling us to access an infinity of information and knowledge and learning opportunities. Everything is on the Web!But the ultimate missing ingredient is the richness and variety and artfulness of a conversation between two human beings who learn from each other.At Share & Learn, we try to create a social environment based on trust, respect and compassion, so that people feel free to ask questions, to learn and to share what they know.Sure, we all need to learn -- in our personal and professional lives. But it doesn't mean we can't have fun doing it, it doesn't mean we can't meet new people and make new friends!Is Share &amp; Learn useful to companies as well?Absolutely. Companies want employees to develop the learning reflex and to increase productivity through Kaizen or some other management technique. But ultimately, the challenge is: How do you create, in human beings, the natural desire to learn?The answer is, just put them in an environment where there tons and tons of learning resources and passionate experts and caring teachers. And just sit back and watch people waking up to a second childhood!What do you mean by "learning resources"?I mean anything from a book to a PowerPoint presentation to a white paper or educational Flash presentation or CD-ROM or DVD or audiotape, etc. These can be called learning objects.What's most important is to spark, in people, the great desire to learn, or what Einstein called the "holy curiosity."It won't be too difficult to spark that learning desire, because as kids, we all had it! As we went through the educational system, we acquired a certain nervousness and anxiety due to exams and the constant pressure to perform academically.But in the end, any mature person realizes that life is more than just work work work till you retire. Life is all about learning and growing. Life itself is a process of being born continually, and the more we embrace this "birth" process, the more we enjoy the magical and wonderful things that life offers.

Off-camera, his son asks him to explain where they are and what they're looking at. Previously calm in discussing a piece of equipment in his hands, the elder Wexler turns around and verbally snaps his son's head off, explaining how not to do a documentary.  The interesting thing about the documentary is that it operates on two levels: on one hand, you get a lot of great insights and appreciation for Haskell Wexler's work from a wealth of stars and directors. On the other hand, you also get a movie about the son of a famous father trying to do the same thing and attempting to make a name for himself.

Blogging Review  I cannot agree more with Christina's posting regarding the usefulness of blogs in our CIS class. I think that blogs create an excellent forum where we can discuss issues in a creative, unique environment that many of us have not experienced before. I know at first I was a little intimidated by the idea of a blog, but now, I plan to continue blogging after this class. It is definitely addictive! Besides this, blogging is definitely begginning to take over the world of communication. There was an article on CNN.com today discussing the fact that blogs are now providing some serious competition for traditional media particularly regarding U.S. politics. I think blogs are a great information source, in addition to providing a forum that allows people to be both expressive and creative. Blogging was definitely one of my favorite aspects of class, and I hope more and more people will continue to join the blogging world.

So far, things seem to be going well, with very little violence reported.  I haven't seen any estimates of turnout yet.  Iraq the Model reports:  Probably the worst thing today is the intense heat which was a little over 100f but that didn?t stop the crowds from walking in the sun to the voting stations, I personally had to walk nearly 4 miles in total but it?s definitely worth the effort. The presence of Iraqi army and police units is heavier than it was in January elections and I also noticed that no multinational forces were on the streets and the only sign for their presence was the helicopters that patrolled the skies.  Generally speaking, the process is going smoothly so far and this is encouraging because terrorists usually concentrate their attacks before noon so hopefully it will continue like this for the rest of the day. "  We hope so, too.  UPDATE:  The polls are closed, and the referendum seems to have come off better than anyone could have expected.  There was almost no violence, and turnout was reportedly strong nearly everywhere.  This is a huge victory for the Iraqi people, and a stunning defeat for the terrorists and their allies.  It appears that the military actions that coalition and Iraqi forces have carried out over the past two months have been remarkably successful in degrading the terrorists' capabilities.    President Bush talked about the election in his radio address today.  He also discussed the Zawahiri letter:  This weekend?s election is a critical step forward in Iraq?s march toward democracy, and with each step the Iraqi people take, al Qaeda?s vision for the region becomes more remote.  As Iraqis prepared for this election, the world learned of a letter written by a leading terrorist explaining why Iraq is the central front in their war on civilization.  Al Qaeda?s number two leader, a man named Zawahiri, wrote to his chief deputy in Iraq, the terrorist Zarqawi.  We intercepted this letter, and we have released it to the public.  In it, Zawahiri lays out why al Qaeda views Iraq as 'the place for the greatest battle' of our day.  He says that establishing al Qaeda?s dominion over Iraq is the first step towards their larger goal of imposing Islamic radicalism across the broader Middle East.  Zawahiri writes:  'The jihad in Iraq requires several incremental goals.  The first stage:  Expel the Americans from Iraq.  The second stage:  Establish an Islamic authority over as much territory as you can to spread its power in Iraq.  The third stage:  Extend the jihad wave to the secular countries neighboring Iraq.'   This letter shows that al Qaeda intends to make Iraq a terrorist haven and a staging ground for attacks against other nations, including the United States.  The letter makes equally clear that the terrorists have a problem:  Their campaign of murder and mayhem is turning the people against them.  The letter warns Zarqawi that, 'many of your Muslim admirers amongst the common folk are wondering about your attacks on the Shia.'  Even al Qaeda recognizes that with every random bombing and every funeral of a child, the Muslim world sees the terrorists for what they really are:  murderers at war with the Iraqi people.   These terrorists are driven by an ideology that exploits Islam to serve a violent political vision:  the establishment of a totalitarian empire that denies political and religious freedom.  This is why the terrorists have fought to prevent and disrupt this weekend's elections.  They understand that the act of voting is a rejection of them and their distorted vision of Islam.  Simply by coming out to vote, the Iraqi people have shown that they want to live in freedom, and they will not accept a return to tyranny and terror.  The terrorists know their only chance for success is to break our will and force us to retreat.  The al Qaeda letter points to Vietnam as a model.  Zawahiri says:  'The aftermath of the collapse of American power in Vietnam, and how they ran and left their agents, is noteworthy.'  Al Qaeda believes that America can be made to run again.  They are gravely mistaken. America will not run, and we will not forget our responsibilities.   In Iraq, we have brought down a murderous regime.  We have stood by the Iraqi people through two elections, and we will stand by them until they have established a free nation that can govern itself, sustain itself, and defend itself.  When we do, Iraq will be an ally in the war on terror and a partner for peace and moderation in the Muslim world.  And because America stood firm in this important fight, our children and grandchildren will be safer and more secure. "  President Bush can take great pride in this historic day.
Blogging experience  I don't know what a blog is before the CIS class either. I think overall the blogging experience is positive. First, I was able to read other interesting articles and opinions. Second, I was able to express my opinion freely as well. So I think putting blog as part of curriculum is very good.
Charity to man's fellow man is praiseworthy, and Americans are the most generous people on Earth. According to a quote by American philanthropist Daniel Rose in "An Exceptional Nation," an article in Philanthropy magazine (November/December 2004), "American private charitable contributions this year will exceed $200 billion, equal to about 10 percent of the total federal budget; that some 70 percent of U.S. households make charitable cash contributions; and that over half of all U.S. adults will volunteer an estimated 20 billion hours in charitable activities." Americans contribute six or seven times more than some of our European neighbors.
Blogs!!!!    I didn’t know blogging was such a happening thing, and that it was spreading so rampantly Let me back up my sudden realization with some statistics: There are some 9 million blogs out there, with 40,000 new ones popping up each day. Some discuss poetry, others constitutional law. And, yes, many are plain silly. "Mommy tells me it may rain today. Oh Yucky Dee Doo," reads one April posting. Let's assume that 99.9% are equally off point. So what? That leaves some 40 new ones every day that could be talking about your business, engaging your employees, or leaking those merger discussions you thought were hush-hush. The overwhelming majority of the information the world spews out every day is sdigital -- photos from camera phones, PowerPoint presentations, government filings, billions and billions of e-mails, even digital phone messages. With a couple of clicks, every one of these items can be broadcast into the blogosphere by anyone with an Internet hookup -- or even a cell phone. If it's scandalous, a poisonous e-mail from a CEO, for example, or torture pictures from a prison camp, others link to it in a flash. And here's the killer: Blog posts linger on the Web forever. (As far as I remember James Drogan said this when he had come for the guest lecture.) Yet not all the news is scary. Ideas circulate as fast as scandal. Potential customers are out there, sniffing around for deals and partners. While you may be putting it off, you can bet that your competitors are exploring ways to harvest new ideas from blogs, sprinkle ads into them, and yes, find out what you and other competitors are up to. Blogging has become a challenge for mass media; printing press. Anyone with a computer and an internet connection can become a blog publisher, he just has to set up a free account with blogger. Blogs are a media of the masses. Blogs are posing new challenges for businesses, because a vast new stretch of the information world opens up. Employees, customers, shareholders can access such information easily. I think if businesses don’t catch up with the ever growing blogging world then the following verse will hold true: “Catch up….. or catch you later”.
Book Reviews: Despite their importance to Hollywood's financial bottom line both domestically and abroad, action movies always seem to get short shrift from the film elite. Author Eric Lichtenfeld attempts to correct that oversight with his compelling genre study "Action Speaks Louder." It's the perfect accompaniment to the high-octane summer movie season.

Book Reviews: Since he burst onto the scene with "She's Gotta Have It" and "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee has gone from America's most provocative black filmmaker to a somewhat marginalized figure, seen more often courtside at Knicks games than on the red carpet. With the upcoming Imagine/U big-budget pic "Inside Man" reteaming Lee with star Denzel Washington, Kaleem Aftab's biog is a timely reminder of what Lee has accomplished and why he matters.
Another of Cameron Crowe?s heart-warmers in which a young man discovers himself during a journey. Orlando Bloom stars as a shoe designer considering suicide after a spectacular design failure. His father dies during a homecoming visit to Kentucky, and Bloom flies out for the funeral. On an otherwise deserted airplane, he meets a flight attendant (Kirsten Dunst) in what can only be described as a Meet Cute or Die. She insists on entering his life, and a good thing, too, because she saves it. Susan Sarandon plays the widow, still blamed by the locals for kidnapping her husband and spiriting him away to the coast. Not one of Crowe?s great films like ?Almost Famous,? but sweet and good-hearted and with some real laughs. Note: Crowe shortened the movie by 18 minutes after its Toronto Film Festival debut, much improving it in the process.

If nothing else, true or not, Ryan Reynolds can come demonize my house any time. Even if you cut off his head with a chainsaw Ryan Reynolds body would still be the hottest in film today. Daaaaamn! Even the men can get a man crush on him and not feel ashamed. But Im telling the women out there, prepare to be empowered and get the pause button ready because while the movie is only eighty-nine minutes long, it might take all night to get through it with as many shots of Reynolds chest and arms as there are. Glory Hallelujah!
