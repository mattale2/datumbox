Our current broken immigration system has fueled, among other things, violence against contributing members of our community. I am referring to the recent murders, beatings and rape of Latino agricultural farm workers in South Georgia. Has our society gotten to the point that labels such as "illegal" connote "otherness" to such a degree that our immigrant brothers and sisters are beaten to death as a matter of course? We must all work together to ensure that these attacks are the last.
